# WOLifecycle Maven Plugin

The wolifecycle-maven-plugin is a Maven plugin to assist in the development and packaging of WebObjects applications and frameworks.

**Version**: 2.3

## Usage

You must add the wolifecycle-maven-plugin to the pom.xml in the `build` section according to the following snippet:

```
<build>

      <extensions>true</extensions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

You can configure the `packaging` property if you want your Maven build to produce a WO framework package:

<packaging>woapplication</packaging>
```

## History

The maven-wolifecycle-plugin was initially developed by Andrus Adamchik and Ulrich KÃ¶ster in the context of the WOProject/WOLips<sup>1</sup> with the support of [objectstyle.org](http://objectstyle.org). In 2012, the control of the WOLips project was handed to [wocommunity.org](http://wocommunity.org). At some point, managing the changes of the maven-wolifecyle-plugin inside the WOLips project became cumbersome. This project was created to overcome these obstacles.

<sup>1</sup> WOLips is an Eclipse plugin to develop WebObjects applications.
